## 🪐 Mercury

Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and the closest to the Sun. It has a rocky surface filled with craters and experiences extreme temperature changes because it has almost no atmosphere.

* Fun Facts:
A year on Mercury is just 88 Earth days.
Temperatures swing from extreme heat to freezing cold.
Despite being closest to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet.
One Mercury day is longer than its year!

## 🌕 Venus

Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is often called Earth’s twin due to its similar size. However, its thick carbon-dioxide atmosphere traps heat, making it the hottest planet in the solar system.
